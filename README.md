My Dearest Mochi,

I know I have hurt you, and for that, my heart feels so heavy. The last thing I ever want is to make you sad, and knowing that I did breaks me inside. I never meant to upset you, and if I could take back my words or actions, I would do it in a heartbeat.

Please know that my love for you is far greater than any mistake Iâ€™ve made. You mean so much to me, and I hate the thought of us being distant because of this. I truly value what we have, and I will do everything I can to make things right.

I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I miss your smile, your warmth, and the way you make my world so much better. I promise to learn from this, to be better, and to always cherish you the way you deserve.

I love you, Mochi, and I always will.

Forever yours,
Mistu ðŸ’•
